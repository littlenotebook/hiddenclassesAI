HiddenClasses is an AI-powered media project that surfaces unconventional, niche career paths and micro-skills people can explore. The AI reframes careers as exploratory, non-linear, and playful. It identifies uncommon roles, clusters related skills, and translates them into short, engaging social media posts.
